# Do you have distributed systems?
In pratical, YES.
In theoretically, NO.
If you have unlimited money and time and a device which supports unlimited operations in the only one device, you may have NOT needed 

since you always can evaluate them only in your device.

BUT,....In practice, most people don't have the ability to meet the above requirements. We have limited time and resources.

Thus, we have to distribute data storage and cloud computing to many different devices.

This is trade-off. That is we have to consider which one is the best for us.

Some one have a misconcept. When encountering a nottleneck, we can solve it by upgrading and adding the hardware device as many as possible,

Such as one said, if the devices has a poorer perfomance, then I can solve it by adding more CPUs and memories.

BUT,.... Wait? Does it brings a linear perfomrmance imporvement?

Unfortunately, NO.

這裡的 cluster size 指的不是 server 的數量，而是 core 的數量（就是 CPU 有幾個 core 的那個 core；

現代的電腦都是按照 Von Neumann architecture 設計，所以要處理越多需求，就需要越多 core 來處理，通常這裡指的 high-end machine 都有超多 core）
